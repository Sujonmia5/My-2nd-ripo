            <p>Hey, this is my homepage, so I have to say something about myself. <i class="bold">But Sometime it is hard to introduction yourself.</i> Because you know yourself so well that you do not know where to start with. Let me give a try to see what kind of image you have about me through my self-description. I hope that my impression about myself and your impression about me are not so different.</p>

            <p>I am a person who is positive about every aspect of life.<u>There are many things I like to do, to see, and to experience.</u> I like to read, I like to write; I like to think, I like to dream; I like to talk, I like to listen. I like to see The sunrise in the morning, I like to see The moonlight at night; I like to feel the music flowing on my face, I like to smell the wind coming from the ocean. I like to look at the clouds in the sky with a blank mind, I like to do thought experiment when I cannot sleep in the middle of the night. I like flowers in spring, rain in summer, leaves in autumn, and snow in winter. I like to sleep early, I like to get up late; I like to be alone, I like to be surrounded by people. I like country’s peace, I like metropolis’ noise; I like the beautiful west lake in Hangzhou, I like the flat cornfield in Champaign. I like delicious food and comfortable shoes; I like good books and romantic movies. I like the land and the nature, I like people. And, I like to laugh.</p>
